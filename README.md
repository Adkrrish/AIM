## ⚠️ Current Limitations & Accuracy

### 🎯 **Analysis Accuracy Status**
- ✅ **Highly Accurate**: Color palette extraction and visual style analysis
- ✅ **Reliable**: Hashtag counting and basic sentiment detection
- 🔶 **Moderate Accuracy**: Tone of voice and emotional appeal analysis
- 🔶 **Developing**: CTA strength detection and readability scoring

### 🚧 **Prompt Generation Quality**
The current AI-generated prompts serve as **foundational starting points** rather than production-ready campaign assets. While they capture strategic direction and competitor insights, they require human creativity and refinement for optimal results.

### 📈 **Future Development Scope**
This project represents a **proof-of-concept** with significant potential for enhancement:
- 🔬 **Advanced NLP models** for better tone and emotion analysis
- 🎨 **Sophisticated visual AI** for deeper image understanding
- 🎯 **Fine-tuned prompt generation** using domain-specific training data
- 📊 **Real performance validation** against actual campaign metrics

> **Note**: The analyzer demonstrates AI's potential in marketing intelligence but should be viewed as a strategic assistant rather than a replacement for human marketing expertise.
